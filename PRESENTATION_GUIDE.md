# Security and Integration Guide for Test Case Generator

## Overview

This document provides guidance on securely integrating the Test Case Generator application into classified environments. It covers security considerations, implementation options for platform knowledge, and best practices for maintaining security while using the tool.

## Security Assessment

### Security Features

1. **Local Processing**
   - All test case generation happens locally on the user's machine
   - No data is transmitted externally by default (demo mode uses mock responses)
   - No sensitive information is stored persistently

2. **Controlled Data Access**
   - The application only accesses files that are explicitly selected by the user
   - No automatic scanning of directories or systems
   - Clear user interface showing exactly what's being processed

3. **Classified Information Protection**
   - Platform types (A, B, Z) are only used as identifiers
   - No specific details about classified systems are embedded in the code
   - Test case generation is generic and doesn't require knowledge of classified details

4. **Configurable API Usage**
   - By default, runs in "demo mode" with no external API calls
   - API keys are only used if explicitly provided
   - Can be configured to run entirely offline

### Security Recommendations

1. **Network Isolation**
   - Run the application in an environment without internet access
   - Ensure no API keys are configured to prevent accidental external calls
   - Verify network traffic is not leaving the secure environment

2. **Access Controls**
   - Restrict access to the application using OS-level permissions
   - Consider implementing a simple authentication mechanism
   - Log all usage for audit purposes

3. **Data Handling**
   - Store input and output files in approved secure locations
   - Follow proper procedures for handling generated test cases
   - Implement secure deletion of temporary files

4. **Code Review**
   - Have your security team review the code before deployment
   - Verify no sensitive information is embedded
   - Ensure compliance with your organization's security policies

## Implementing Platform Knowledge

### Option 1: Preset Configuration (Recommended for Classified Environments)

1. **Hardcode Platform Types**
   - Modify the radio button options in `ui_app.py` to match your specific platforms
   - Update the descriptions in the help dialogs with accurate information
   - Edit the `_show_platform_help()` and `_show_version_help()` methods

   ```python
   # Example modification in ui_app.py
   ttk.Radiobutton(
       radio_frame, 
       text="Platform Alpha", # Change from "Platform A" to your actual platform name
       variable=self.machine_type, 
       value="A"
   ).grid(row=0, column=0, padx=15, pady=5, sticky=tk.W)
   ```

2. **Create Platform-Specific Test Templates**
   - Add JSON files in the `data/shared_steps` directory for each platform
   - Name them according to platform (e.g., `A_login.json`, `B_security_check.json`)
   - Structure:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "SS-PLATFORM_A-001",
     "title": "Platform A Login Procedure",
     "steps": [
       "Navigate to the secure login screen",
       "Enter authorized credentials",
       "Complete two-factor authentication"
     ],
     "expected_results": [
       "Login screen appears with proper security indicators",
       "System accepts valid credentials",
       "Two-factor authentication succeeds"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Customize Test ID Format**
   - Modify the `_generate_test_id()` method in `agent.py` to match your organization's naming conventions
   - Example:

   ```python
   def _generate_test_id(self, machine_type: str = None, version: str = None) -> str:
       """Generate a unique test ID following organization standards."""
       import uuid
       import time
       
       # Use timestamp and partial UUID for uniqueness
       timestamp = int(time.time())
       short_uuid = str(uuid.uuid4())[:6]
       
       # If machine type and version are provided, include them in the ID
       if machine_type and version:
           # Replace dots in version with underscores
           version_str = version.replace('.', '_')
           return f"SEC_{machine_type}_{version_str}_{timestamp}_{short_uuid}"
       else:
           return f"SEC_GEN_{timestamp}_{short_uuid}"
   ```

### Option 2: Dynamic Configuration (More Flexible but Less Secure)

1. **External Configuration File**
   - Create a configuration file (JSON or YAML) with platform definitions
   - Example `platforms.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "platforms": [
       {
         "id": "A",
         "name": "Platform Alpha",
         "description": "Standard security configuration",
         "versions": ["1.0", "2.0", "3.0"],
         "features": ["Basic authentication", "Standard UI"]
       },
       {
         "id": "B",
         "name": "Platform Beta",
         "description": "Enhanced security configuration",
         "versions": ["1.0", "2.0"],
         "features": ["Advanced authentication", "Enhanced UI"]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Load Configuration at Startup**
   - Add code to load the configuration file
   - Populate UI elements dynamically
   - Example:

   ```python
   def _load_platform_config(self):
       """Load platform configuration from file."""
       try:
           with open("config/platforms.json", "r") as f:
               config = json.load(f)
               return config.get("platforms", [])
       except Exception as e:
           logger.error(f"Error loading platform configuration: {str(e)}")
           return []
   ```

## Implementation Steps for Classified Environments
