1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for the Easy Demo platform, which provides a simplified interface for demonstrating and testing industrial control systems.

2. Functional Requirements

REQ-001: The system shall provide a graphical interface for monitoring real-time sensor data.

REQ-002: The system shall allow users to calibrate sensors through the calibration wizard.

REQ-003: The system shall record and store measurement data in a structured database format.

REQ-004: The system shall generate diagnostic reports based on collected sensor data.

REQ-005: The system shall provide alarm notifications when sensor readings exceed configured thresholds.

REQ-006: The system shall support remote access to monitoring functions via secure connection.

REQ-007: The system shall allow configuration of data sampling rates for each connected sensor.

REQ-008: The system shall provide data visualization through customizable charts and graphs.

REQ-009: The system shall support export of collected data in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, XML).

REQ-010: The system shall maintain an audit log of all user actions and system events.

3. Non-Functional Requirements

REQ-011: The system shall respond to user interface actions within 500 milliseconds.

REQ-012: The system shall support at least 50 concurrent sensor connections.

REQ-013: The system shall operate continuously for at least 30 days without requiring a restart.

REQ-014: The system shall maintain data accuracy within Â±0.1% of actual values.

REQ-015: The system shall comply with IEC 61508 safety standards for industrial control systems.

4. Platform-Specific Requirements

REQ-016: For Easy Demo platform, the system shall provide a simplified interface mode for demonstration purposes.

REQ-017: For Easy Demo platform, the system shall include pre-configured demo scenarios for common industrial processes.

REQ-018: For Easy Demo platform, the system shall support simulation of sensor data for demonstration when physical sensors are not available.

5. Version-Specific Requirements

REQ-019: For Version 1.0, the system shall support basic monitoring and calibration functions.

REQ-020: For Version 2.0, the system shall support advanced analytics and predictive maintenance features.

REQ-023: The system shall support the following sensor types: temperature (RTD, thermocouple), pressure, flow, level, and vibration.

REQ-024: The system shall communicate with sensors using industry standard protocols (4-20mA, HART, Modbus, Profibus).

REQ-025: The system shall store at least 1 year of historical data for trend analysis.

REQ-026: The system shall provide a web-based interface accessible via standard browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

REQ-027: The system shall support user authentication and role-based access control.

REQ-028: The system shall perform automatic sensor health checks at configurable intervals.

REQ-029: The system shall provide a REST API for integration with external systems.

REQ-030: The system shall support configuration backup and restore functions.
